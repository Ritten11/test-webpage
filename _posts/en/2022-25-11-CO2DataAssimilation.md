<!-- excerpt-start -->

The environment is changing due to anthropogenic carbon emissions, and so is the carbon cycle regulating the exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e. fluxes) between the Earthâ€™s surface and the atmosphere. Measuring these changes is difficult, as it would require enormously dense observation networks to capture the strongly heterogeneous underlying flux-landscape. Through a combination of carbon exchange (CE) models and data assimilation (DA), the CarbonTracker data assimilation shell (CTDAS) generates a flux-landscape estimate which optimally matches the available observations. The current implementation of this DA approach is static; flux-landscape estimates produced in the past are not used for estimating new flux-landscapes. However, preliminary research has shown that seasonal, currently unused, patterns are present within the estimates of the DA approach. 

We propose three different methods for utilizing these patterns: a simple monthly mean model, a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model. Preliminary results strongly indicate that the monthly mean model provides a substantial improvement over the current DA implementation once incorporated within CTDAS. In contrast, the SARIMA and SARIMAX models struggle to capture the non-stationary seasonal patterns.
