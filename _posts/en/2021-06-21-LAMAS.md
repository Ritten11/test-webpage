For the course 'Logica Aspects of Multi-agent Systems (LAMaS)', me and two fellow students modeled 'The Resistance' using epistemic logic. The Resistance is a multiplayer deductive reasoning role-playing game. Using a multi-agent-based approach, we tested how the usage of higher-order knowledge could increase the win-rate of the agents. The [full report][website] and [implementation][github-page] are available online. The final grade for the project was a 9.
