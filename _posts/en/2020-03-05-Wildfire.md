<!-- excerpt-start -->

For my bachelors project, I used reinforcement learning to train an
agent in controlling forest fires. In order to do so, me and three other
 students from the University of Groningen build a forest fire simulation 
and implemented several reinforcement learning techniques. My main 
contributions were the agent implementations and the connectionist monte-
Carlo algorithm inplementation. The final grade awarded to this project 
was a 7.5.
